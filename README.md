- Start the game by placing your 12 tigers on intersection points of lines on the map.
- Goats (you) can only move one space in any direction which is not occupied
- Tigers can either move one space like you, or they can jump pver you to an empty spot, eating you goat.
- You lose the game when you lose more than half of your goats.
- Tigers are programmed to always eat a goat when the opportunity is there. 
- Tigers are also programmed to more strategically move themselves and not just random.
